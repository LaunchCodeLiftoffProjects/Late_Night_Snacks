# Late Night Snacks: Food Truck Webapp

### Overview

Our group decided to create a webapp for a food truck. With the nature of food trucks being on the move all the time, we believe that communication with current and prospective customers is highly important. The easier it is for them to find the food truck, the better it is. Even more, the easier it is for them to order the food, the better it is. Therefore, we want to create an app that would eventually accomplish all of that; we want to create an app that removes the barrier between a food truck and its customers.

Through our webapp, food truck owner would be able to update the menu, update the location, alert customers, access orders, update calendar, and create custom notifications for customers. Basically, the owner would have all they need to update the customers with the latest important information.

The customers would then get these features; they would be able to quickly order, preorder for a pick up at later time, find out where the food truck is currently at, get notifications via SMS and/or email about special events, promotions, and status of their orders, access the food truck calendar, and access other basic information such as the homepage, contact page, and about us page. We hope that this will make both the customers and the food truck owner have a better and easier business experience.

### Features

Here are the features that we are hoping to implement:
* Customer login: By having a stored profile, customers can order, reorder from history, and later on even leave a review.
* Ordering: We want to let customers to easily order, reorder from history, and even customize their order by adding or leaving some ingredients.
* Calendar: We want to let customers know what we are up to.
* Location Map: We want to give customers easy visualization of where we are, and even navigate to our location easily.
* Homepage: Landing page for prospective customers.
* Contact: A way to get in touch for questions and/or concerns.
* Notifcations (SMS and email): A way to let customers know of special events, promotions, and their order status.

### Technologies

We will be building the app using:
* .NET CORE
* C#
* Razor Template
* Twilio API
* Map API (most likely Google Map)
* SQLite (.NET's flavor of SQL database)

### What I'll Have to Learn

Our biggest hurdle would be learning on how to implement different APIs. Besides that, while we have done a few full stack projects and database designs before this, I foresee some struggle with setting up our database. We won't necessarily struggle syntatically, but from design perspective, we need to make sure that the database design is solid. We need one that is flexible enough for future expansion, and yet at the same time not too abstract/general.
